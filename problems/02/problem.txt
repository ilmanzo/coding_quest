Lottery tickets

You have completed your assigned tasks and are free to explore the market near the port where the ship is docked. You grab your belongings and head out for your adventure.

One universal truth about markets is that hawkers outside their stalls can be very pushy, especially with tourists, and the grand markets of Ral'Malgor are no exception.

As you are approaching the main entrance of the markets, one hawker in particular convinces you to purchase some lottery tickets for a draw that is just about to start. You stay to watch the draw on his TV with interest as the numbers are called. You decide you want to calculate your winnings immediately so you can spend the proceeds while souvenir shopping!

The winnings work like this:

A ticket with 3 of the winning numbers wins $1,
A ticket with 4 of the winning numbers wins $10,
A ticket with 5 of the winning numbers wins $100, and
A ticket with 6 of the winning numbers wins $1000.

The winning lottery numbers were 12 48 30 95 15 55 97. Your input data contains the various lottery tickets you purchased. Each line represents a seperate ticket.

Process the input data and calculate the total of your winnings! That is your answer value (without the $ sign).
