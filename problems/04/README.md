# Obsessing over Connect 4

It seems some games exist no matter where in the universe you travel. You stumble across some people who are playing a slightly modified version of the classic childhood game, Connect 4. The main difference is, this is a three player version! Also, this version of connect 4 has 7 rows and 7 columns.

You are invited to join in and quickly become addicted, playing 1000 games in quick succession! (your input data).

You record the game moves on your computer so you can re-live them later. When recording the moves, you simply write down the column that each player drops tokens into, since that is enough information to work out where the token ends up and whose turn it is.

# Your task
Consider the memories of your 1000 games of Connect 4. How many games ended in a draw, or were won by each player?

Your answer is the number of games won by player 1 multiplied by the number of games won by player 2, multiplied again by the number of games won by player 3.

(ie: player_1_wins * player_2_wins * player_3_wins).
